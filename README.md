#SigmaGameTester

---
###Description:
This program generates random sigma games from XOR SAT problems
and then attempts to solve them.

---
###Goals:
####Completed:
* README


####Short Term Plans:
* Give it the ability to solve sigma games
* Create XOR SAT random generator (allow it to take certain parameters restricting the XOR SATs it generates)
* Make it able to turn a XOR SAT into a sigma game problem
